# Storybook Controlled
The primary idea of this library is to codify a best practice for writing stories for controlled components.
The decorator it exposes connects a callback to a piece or pieces of state.
It then hooks into Storybooks testing, actions, and args hooks to update the state when the callback is called.

## Single Callback, Single Parameter
<Description of={ButtonStories.Primary} />
<Canvas of={ButtonStories.Primary} />

## Single Callback, Multiple Parameters
